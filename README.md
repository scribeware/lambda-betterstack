# lambda-google-cloud-logging

This is **lambda-google-cloud-logging**, a Lambda function to forward logs from CloudWatch to [Google Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging). It is built with the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/), and is a perfect companion to the [`serverless-log-forwarding`](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-log-forwarding) plugin.

## Getting Started

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 12.x, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac), and the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). Then clone this repository & install dependencies:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local tests:
npm test
```

Next, configure `serverless-dev` (for dev & QA stages) and `serverless-production` IAM roles:

```sh
$ aws configure --profile serverless-dev
AWS Access Key ID [None]: **************
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: **************
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: text

$ aws configure --profile serverless-production
AWS Access Key ID [None]: **************
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: **************
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: text
```

Finally, run either `npm run deploy:dev`, `npm run deploy:qa`, or `npm run deploy:prod` to deploy!

## Usage

You can now easily forward logs from any other Serverless application with [`serverless-log-forwarding`](https://github.com/amplify-education/serverless-log-forwarding).

```yml
plugins:
  - serverless-log-forwarding

custom:
  logForwarding:
    destinationARN: ${cf:lambda-google-cloud-logging-${opt:stage}.ForwarderLambdaArn}
```

You can also manually attach a log group by clicking **Actions â†’ Stream to AWS Lambda** from the [CloudWatch Log Groups dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logs:). Then just choose the appropriate destination Lambda function (e.g. `lambda-google-cloud-logging-prod-forwarder`) and configure a filter (or "Other" to forward all log messages).

## Configuration

Before deploying, you'll need to set up the following AWS Systems Manager (SSM) parameters:

- `/prod/google-cloud-project-id`: Your Google Cloud Project ID
- `/prod/google-cloud-log-name`: The name of the log in Google Cloud Logging (optional, defaults to 'cloudwatch-forwarded-logs')
- `/prod/google-application-credentials`: Path to your Google Cloud service account key file or JSON content

### Google Cloud Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud project or use an existing one
2. Enable the Cloud Logging API
3. Create a service account with the "Logging Writer" role
4. Download the service account key file
5. Store the key file path or JSON content in SSM parameter `/prod/google-application-credentials`
